The intention is to produce articles and perhaps a few small scipts on some aspects of loudspeaker engineering. The focus will be on topics that are currently not well covered within the DIY community. For example, there will be little on passive crossovers but hopefully a fair amount on 3D design considerations.

The site will contain little useful information for a month or two while things are worked on locally.
